##**1.Magic Square**

**Objective** :  To generate odd order magic square 
This C++ program generates an odd-order Magic Square using the Siamese Method. It starts from the middle of the first row, placing numbers sequentially while moving up-left. If the position is occupied, it moves down instead. The process repeats until the n Ã— n grid is filled. The sum of each row, column, and diagonal remains constant. 

**Time Complexity Analysis**
â€¢	The program fills the nÃ—n times nÃ—n matrix exactly once.
â€¢	Each number from 1 to n2n is placed in one iteration.
â€¢	Checking and updating positions is O(1) for each step.
Thus, the overall time complexity is:
O(n^2) 
where n is the size of the square.

##**2. 1D Peak**

**Objective** : This C++ program finds a peak element in an array using a binary search-based approach.
This C++ program finds a peak element in an array using Binary Search.
A peak is an element greater than or equal to its neighbors.
â€¢	If the array has only one element, it is the peak.
â€¢	The first or last element is a peak if it's greater than its only neighbor.
â€¢	Any middle element greater than both adjacent elements is also a peak.
â€¢	The program recursively searches in the direction where a peak is more likely to exist.
The program prints the index of a peak element in logarithmic time O(log n).

## 3. **2D Peak**

**Objective** : finding the 2D peak from an 2D array/Matrix
This C++ program finds a peak element in a 2D matrix, where a peak is an element that is greater than its left, right, upper, and lower neighbors.
**Approach:**
1.	Binary search on columns:
o	Pick the middle column.
o	Find the maximum element in this column.
2.	Check if it's a peak:
o	If it is greater than its left, right, upper, and lower neighbors, it's a peak.
o	Otherwise, move the search left or right where a larger element exists.
3.	This ensures an O(n log m) time complexity.
**Output**:The program prints the coordinates (row, column) of a peak element, or "No peak found".

## **Power Calculation using logn **

**Objective**: To find the a to the power b without the n^2 complexity

Power of a Number (Recursive Approach)
This C++ program calculates a^b (a raised to the power of b) using recursion.
**Approach:**
â€¢	Base Case: If b == 0, return 1.
â€¢	Recursive Case:
o	If b is even, compute power(a, b/2) once and square it.
o	If b is odd, multiply a with power(a, b/2) * power(a, b/2).
**Time Complexity:** 
â€¢	This implementation is inefficient (O(2^log b)) because it computes power(a, b/2) twice.
â€¢	It can be optimized using exponentiation by squaring to O(log b).

**4. Iterative Quick sort :**
   
 This program implements QuickSort using an iterative approach instead of recursion. It sorts an array of integers entered by the user. The program uses a stack to replace the recursive function calls, making it more memory-efficient compared to the traditional recursive QuickSort.
**How It Works**
1.	The user enters the size of the array and its elements.
2.	The Iterative QuickSort algorithm is applied to sort the array.
3.	The sorted array is displayed as output.
**Algorithm**
1.	Partitioning:
o	Select the first element as the pivot.
o	Rearrange elements so that smaller elements are on the left and larger ones on the right.
o	Place the pivot in its correct position.
2.	Iterative QuickSort using a Stack:
o	Push the low and high indices onto the stack instead of using recursion.
o	Keep processing subarrays until the stack is empty.
**Time Complexity**
â€¢	Best/Average Case (O(n log n)) â€“ When the pivot divides the array into nearly equal halves.
â€¢	Worst Case (O(nÂ²)) â€“ If the pivot is always the smallest or largest element (unbalanced partitioning).

                          **graph is same like a recursive quick sort **
  	

**5. Finding the min and maximum using devide and conquer :**

**Overview:**
This program finds the minimum and maximum values in an array using the divide and conquer approach. Instead of a simple linear scan, it recursively divides the array into smaller parts, finds the min-max in each part, and then merges the results efficiently.
**Algorithm Explanation**
1.	Recursive Division:
o	If the array has one element, it is both min and max.
o	Otherwise, the array is divided into two halves.
o	The min-max of each half is computed recursively.
2.	Merging Results:
o	The min-max of both halves are compared, and the final min-max is determined.
**Time Complexity Analysis**
Let T(n) be the time complexity of the algorithm:
â€¢	Divide Step: The array is split into two halves â†’ O(1).
â€¢	Recursive Calls: Two recursive calls for two halves â†’ T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(1).
â€¢	Merging Step: Takes O(1) constant time.
**Solving the recurrence using the Master Theorem, we get:**
â€¢	Best & Average Case Complexity: O(n)
â€¢	Worst Case Complexity: O(n)

**   6. Checking the point is in the triagle or not :**

**Overview : ** This program determines whether a given point (x, y) lies inside a triangle defined by three vertices (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3) using the cross-product method.

**Algorithm Explanation**
**1.	Cross Product Calculation:**
o	The cross product of two vectors determines the relative orientation of a point to a line.
o	The sign of the cross product tells whether a point lies to the left or right of a directed line segment.
**2.	Conditions for a Point Inside the Triangle:**
o	If the point (x, y) lies inside the triangle, it must be on the same side of all three triangle edges.
o	This means all three cross products have the same sign (either all positive or all negative).
**Time Complexity Analysis**
The algorithm performs a constant number of calculations (three cross-product evaluations and three comparisons), making it:
â€¢	Time Complexity: O(1) (Constant Time)
â€¢	Space Complexity: O(1) (No Extra Space Used)



**7. Activity Selection problem **

The Activity Selection Problem is a greedy algorithm problem where we aim to select the maximum number of non-overlapping activities that can be performed by activity selection problem 

**Overview**
This C++ program implements an activity selection problem where multiple activities have a start time, end time, and profit. The goal is to select the maximum number of non-overlapping activities using different sorting strategies.

**How It Works**
1.	The user enters the number of activities (n).
2.	For each activity, the user provides:
o	Start Time
o	End Time
o	Profit
3.	The program sorts and selects activities using the three sorting strategies.
4.	It prints the selected activities and the maximum number of non-overlapping activities for each approach.
**Complexity Analysis**
â€¢	Sorting: O(n log n) (using std::sort()).
â€¢	Activity selection: O(n) (iterating through activities).
â€¢	Overall complexity: O(n log n) + O(n) = O(n log n). 


**8. Median of an array **

**Overview**
This C++ program finds the median of an unsorted array using the QuickSelect algorithm, an efficient selection algorithm similar to QuickSort. It avoids full sorting and finds the median in O(n) average time complexity.
**How It Works**
**1.	QuickSelect Algorithm**
o	Selects the k-th smallest element without sorting the entire array.
o	Uses a partitioning technique similar to QuickSort.
**2.	Finding the Median**
o	If the array has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element.
o	If the array has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements.
o	QuickSelect is used to find both elements efficiently.
**Time Complexity Analysis**
â€¢	Best/Average Case: O(n) (Linear time, as we only partition necessary parts of the array).
â€¢	Worst Case: O(nÂ²) (Occurs when always picking the worst pivot, but can be improved with random pivot selection).

**9. Dikastra's algorithm **

**Overview**
This C++ program implements Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm to find the shortest path from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a graph. It uses a randomly generated weighted adjacency matrix to represent the graph.

**How It Works**
1.	Graph Representation:
o	The graph is represented using a cost adjacency matrix (cost[i][j] stores the weight of the edge between vertex i and j).
o	Edge weights are randomly assigned (values between 1 and 10, with higher values set as INF for disconnected edges).
2.	Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm:
o	A distance array (dist[]) stores the shortest known distance from the source vertex.
o	A flag array (flag[]) keeps track of visited nodes.
o	At each step, the node with the minimum distance is selected, and its neighboring distances are updated.

**Time Complexity Analysis**
â€¢	Best/Average Case: O(nÂ²) (Using an adjacency matrix without a priority queue).
â€¢	Optimized version with a min-heap (not implemented here) would be O((n + e) log n).

**1 . Kruskal algorithm ** 

**Overview**
This C++ program implements Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a given graph. It uses a min-heap (priority queue) for efficient edge selection and a union-find data structure to detect cycles while adding edges to the MST.

**How It Works**
1.	Graph Representation:
o	The graph is represented as an edge list, where each edge consists of:
ï‚§	a: Start vertex
ï‚§	b: End vertex
ï‚§	c: Weight (cost) of the edge
o	The edges are stored in a vector and arranged in a min-heap for efficient selection of the smallest edge.
2.	Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm:
o	Uses a Min-Heap to sort edges by increasing weight.
o	Uses Union-Find (Disjoint Set) to check for cycles before adding an edge to the MST.
o	Continues until we have n-1 edges in the MST or the edges are exhausted.

**Time Complexity Analysis**
â€¢	Heap Construction: O(E log E) (Sorting edges using min-heap).
â€¢	Find & Union Operations: O(E log V) (Using Union-Find with path compression).
â€¢	Overall Complexity: O(E log E) (Efficient for sparse graphs).



**2. Prim's algorithm **

**Overview**

Primâ€™s Algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a weighted, undirected graph. The MST connects all vertices with the minimum possible total edge weight without forming cycles.

**How the Algorithm Works**
1.	Start with any vertex.
2.	Select the smallest edge connecting a visited vertex to an unvisited one.
3.	Mark the selected vertex as visited.
