# Day 1
##**1.Magic Square**

**Objective** :  To generate odd order magic square 
This C++ program generates an odd-order Magic Square using the Siamese Method. It starts from the middle of the first row, placing numbers sequentially while moving up-left. If the position is occupied, it moves down instead. The process repeats until the n Ã— n grid is filled. The sum of each row, column, and diagonal remains constant. 

**Time Complexity Analysis**
â€¢	The program fills the nÃ—n times nÃ—n matrix exactly once.
â€¢	Each number from 1 to n2n is placed in one iteration.
â€¢	Checking and updating positions is O(1) for each step.
Thus, the overall time complexity is:
O(n^2) 
where n is the size of the square.

##**2. 1D Peak**

**Objective** : This C++ program finds a peak element in an array using a binary search-based approach.
This C++ program finds a peak element in an array using Binary Search.
A peak is an element greater than or equal to its neighbors.
â€¢	If the array has only one element, it is the peak.
â€¢	The first or last element is a peak if it's greater than its only neighbor.
â€¢	Any middle element greater than both adjacent elements is also a peak.
â€¢	The program recursively searches in the direction where a peak is more likely to exist.
The program prints the index of a peak element in logarithmic time O(log n).

##**2D Peak**

**Objective** : finding the 2D peak from an 2D array/Matrix
This C++ program finds a peak element in a 2D matrix, where a peak is an element that is greater than its left, right, upper, and lower neighbors.
**Approach:**
1.	Binary search on columns:
o	Pick the middle column.
o	Find the maximum element in this column.
2.	Check if it's a peak:
o	If it is greater than its left, right, upper, and lower neighbors, it's a peak.
o	Otherwise, move the search left or right where a larger element exists.
3.	This ensures an O(n log m) time complexity.
**Output**:The program prints the coordinates (row, column) of a peak element, or "No peak found".

## **Power Calculation using logn **

**Objective**: To find the a to the power b without the n^2 complexity

Power of a Number (Recursive Approach)
This C++ program calculates a^b (a raised to the power of b) using recursion.
**Approach:**
â€¢	Base Case: If b == 0, return 1.
â€¢	Recursive Case:
o	If b is even, compute power(a, b/2) once and square it.
o	If b is odd, multiply a with power(a, b/2) * power(a, b/2).
**Time Complexity:** 
â€¢	This implementation is inefficient (O(2^log b)) because it computes power(a, b/2) twice.
â€¢	It can be optimized using exponentiation by squaring to O(log b).

Problem : Cosine Similarity : ------

This program calculates the cosine similarity between two text files based on word frequency vectors.

How It Works:
Reads two text files (vector1.txt and vector2.txt).
Processes text:
Converts words to lowercase.
Removes punctuation.
Filters out common words (e.g., "is", "the", "and").
Creates word frequency vectors for both files.
Computes cosine similarity to measure text similarity.

formula used :

cosine similarity = A.B  / ||A|| * ||B||   
A and B are word frequency vectors 

Problem : Heap short -----------
