Day 1 ---------------->>>>

problem : Magic Square --

This C++ program generates an odd-order Magic Square using the Siamese Method. It starts from the middle of the first row, placing numbers sequentially while moving up-left. If the position is occupied, it moves down instead. The process repeats until the n Ã— n grid is filled. The sum of each row, column, and diagonal remains constant.

Problem : Pick with LinearSearch :--

This C++ program finds a peak element in an array. A peak is an element greater than its neighbors.
If the array has one element, it is the peak.
The first or last element is a peak if it's greater than its only neighbor.
Any element greater than both adjacent elements is also a peak.
The program prints the first peak found or "Peak does not exist".

 Problem : pick with BinarySearch :--

This C++ program finds a peak element in an array using Binary Search.
A peak is an element greater than or equal to its neighbors.
If the array has only one element, it is the peak.
The first or last element is a peak if it's greater than its only neighbor.
Any middle element greater than both adjacent elements is also a peak.
The program recursively searches in the direction where a peak is more likely to exist.
The program prints the index of a peak element in logarithmic time O(log n).

Problem :  Pick in 2D ----

This C++ program finds a peak element in a 2D matrix, where a peak is an element that is greater than its left, right, upper, and lower neighbors.
Approach:
Binary search on columns:
  Pick the middle column.
  Find the maximum element in this column.
Check if it's a peak:
  If it is greater than its left, right, upper, and lower neighbors, it's a peak.
  Otherwise, move the search left or right where a larger element exists.
This ensures an O(n log m) time complexity.
Output:
  The program prints the coordinates (row, column) of a peak element, or "No peak found".

 
 Problem : Power Calculation ---
 
This program calculates a^b using Exponentiation by Squaring, reducing time complexity to O(log b).
Approach:
If b == 0, return 1 (base case).
Recursively compute power(a, b/2).
If b is even: result = half * half.
If b is odd: result = a * half * half.



Day2 ---------------------------------------->>>>


Problem : Cosine Similarity : ------

This program calculates the cosine similarity between two text files based on word frequency vectors.

How It Works:
Reads two text files (vector1.txt and vector2.txt).
Processes text:
Converts words to lowercase.
Removes punctuation.
Filters out common words (e.g., "is", "the", "and").
Creates word frequency vectors for both files.
Computes cosine similarity to measure text similarity.

formula used :

cosine similarity = A.B  / ||A|| * ||B||   
A and B are word frequency vectors 

Problem : Heap short -----------

Problem : Merge sort  --------

Overview :
   Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that recursively splits an array into 
   halves, sorts them, and merges them back.

Algorithm Steps :
   Divide the array into two halves.
   Recursively sort each half.
   Merge the sorted halves.
   
Time Complexity :
   Best Case: O(n log n)
   Average Case: O(n log n)

Overview :
   Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that selects a pivot, partitions the 
   array around it, and recursively sorts the subarrays.

Algorithm Steps
  Select a pivot element.
  Partition the array so that elements smaller than the pivot are on the left and larger ones 
  on the right.
  Recursively apply Quick Sort on the left and right subarrays.

Time Complexity

   Average Case: O(n log n)
   Worst Case: O(nÂ²) (when the smallest or largest element is always chosen as pivot)
Space Complexity
   O(log n) (due to recursion stack)
